  The sequence of policy iterations obtained when solving this
  problem.  The plot on the left is the number of cars to ship from
  site A to site B when we have (na,nb) cars at each site at the end
  of the day.  Each car shipped requires a fixed cost of four dollars
  per car and we can transport at most five cars by this method.  The
  image on the right represents the Boolean action of having our
  employee ship one car for us for free.  In addition, there is a
  fixed cost for having more than ten cars parked over night at either
  site.  This manifests itself in the policy by shipping cars one way
  or another to try to minimize this effect.
