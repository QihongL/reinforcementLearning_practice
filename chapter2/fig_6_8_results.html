  A performance comparisons when learning using TD(0) v.s. constant alpha MC
  for various numbers of learning episodes on the <EM>batch</EM> learning
  algorithm on the random walk problem.  This plot is produced when
  the code .m is run.  This code effectively duplicates that presented
  in Figure 6.8 from the book.
